# Ross Pro Shop

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). This project was built with the MERN From Scratch 2023 | eCommerce Platform course taught by Brad Traversy of Traversy Media on Udemy.

## Overview

This is a full stack application using the MERN stack. This is an eCommerce app that includes products, orders, and user authentication! I wanted to learn how to build a project from back to front, and building this app with this course helped!

## Features

- Full-featured shopping cart with quantity
- Product reviews and ratings
- Styling with Bootstrap
- Checkout process (shipping, payment method, etc)
- PayPal / credit card integration
- JWT authentication (JSON web tokens) with HTTP-Only cookie

### Bootstrap Stylings!

- React-Bootstrap UI library
- React-Router Bootstrap library

### React Redux!

- Redux state used in components (useDispatch & useSelector)

### Plus, Admin Features!
- Admin area to manage customers, products & orders
- Admin product management
- Admin user management
- Admin Order details page
- Mark orders as delivered option

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm run dev`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
